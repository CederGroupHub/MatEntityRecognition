  "Transparent bulk silicate undoped and (1%) Eu3+ xerogels were prepared by using the sol\u2013gel method (Aldrich reagents) according to the method described in [20]\u00a0and\u00a0[21]. In the first step tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) was hydrolyzed under constant stirring with a mixed solution of ethanol and water and using glacial acetic acid as catalyst; molar ratio was 1:4:10:0.5. Then another solution of Eu(CH3COO)3, Y(CH3COO)3, Li(CH3COO) and CF3COOH with the molar ratio for Eu:Y:Li:F of 1:5:20:255 was prepared by and added to the first solution. For other molar ratio of Y to Li (i.e. smaller than four) we have obtained glass\u2013ceramic containing only YF3 phase (i.e. for 1 to 1 molar ratio) or a mixture of YF3 and LiYF4 as was reported in Ref. [17]. After an additional vigorous stirring for 1\u00a0h at room temperature, the mixed solution was aged at room temperature for several days in a sealed container. Then the wet-gel obtained was dried up to 120\u00a0\u00b0C during 1 week to form the xerogel. Glass ceramization was obtained after subsequently thermal treatments in air at 530\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. in air. Using the same procedure we have prepared an Eu-doped xerogel and a silica glass.",
  "For the comparison of the optical properties we have prepared LiYF4:Eu3+ (1\u00a0mol.%) polycrystalline by using conventional solid state route: stoichiometric mixture of YF3, EuF3 and LiF (0.99:0.01:1) was thoroughly ground (down to tens on microns size) and dried at 50\u00a0\u00b0C. Then the powder was pressed (as pellets) and sintered at 750\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h in dry nitrogen atmosphere.",

The obtained slurries were dried at 353K in an oven for 24h. The mixed powders were calcined in a mullite crucible at 1423K for 6h. The calcined powders were then ground carefully in mortar and passed through a 200-mesh sieve.

The columbite method was used to synthesize the ceramic powders in order to eliminate the formation of a pyrochlore-type phase. The PZT powder, with the addition of 5% Pb(MgNb)O3, could be completely sintered by maintaining it at 1100\u00b0C for 2h.",

The intimately mixed powders were first heated at 700\u00a0\u00b0C for 14\u00a0h, before regrinding and pressing as pellets (2\u00a0cm diameter). The pellets were then heated at 900\u00a0\u00b0C for 14\u00a0h. Phase purity was determined using X-ray powder diffraction (Panalytical X'pert pro system with an X'celerator detector).

For each case the synthesis conditions employed were carefully optimized on the basis of thermal stability of the phase concerned. The n=2 and \u221e members of the series are stable at high temperatures (above 1000\u00a0\u00b0C), whereas the n=1 and 3 members are stable only at low temperatures and therefore rather difficult to be obtained in single-phase form [23], [24]\u00a0and\u00a0[25].",

For all the four phases, the sample was quenched to room temperature after the final heat treatment, followed by immediate characterization of the as-synthesized sample for phase purity and lattice parameters by means of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; Rikagu RINT2000 equipped with a rotating Cu anode). After the characterization, the as-synthesized samples were exposed to ambient air (temperature 20\u00b12\u00a0\u00b0C, relative humidity 45\u00b110%) or dipped in distilled water in order to study their tendencies to form water derivatives.",

The mixed powders were heated at 1\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0per\u00a0min to 450\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0h under dynamic vacuum to decompose the precursors. The resulting fine, dark brown powder was ground in a mortar and pestle and then heated to 700\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0h in argon in a tube furnace to prevent oxidation of the Mn2+. To complete the reaction, the sample was heated to 900\u00a0\u00b0C for a further 10\u00a0h in argon and allowed to cool to room temperature in the furnace.

The powders obtained were pressed into pellets using isostatic press, (P.O. Weber, Germany) employing a pressure of 300kN for 5min. The pellets were sintered at 900\u00b0C for 24h and 1000-1100\u00b0C for 6h covered with the same powder to suppress potential volatilization of Li2O during the preparation.
